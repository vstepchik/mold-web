"I’ve been long interested in procedural content generation in general, and map "
"generation in particular, and all kinds of process simulation. I usually acted "
"as a theorist, but when it came to implement something I took the tool I was "
"the most proficient with – JVM, and with a high degree of perfectionism I was "
"designing the system architecture, polish to perfection, until my enthusiasm was gone. "
"So nothing was coming out and I had to find my way, fight perfectionism, find tools "
"that make it faster to get results, and thank you " strong { "crew4ok" }
" for keeping shouting on me “GET SHIT DONE!!!” :D. Now, I’ve stopped upon Python "
(icon(PYTHON)) " as it suits me because there are so many scientific libraries "
"in its ecosystem implementing all kinds of algorithms and data structures "
"(often in C/C++ making them really fast). The only thing that I am missing is strong "
"typing, but still you can attach it to Python if you want. Python greatly shortens "
"the time period from the idea to implementation and reserve of enthusiasm is "
"spent more efficiently."

"So, on my way to Amsterdam and back I was reading some articles and blog posts about landscape "
"and world map generation. As it turned out, not as few people are interested in the subject "
"as I expected. They were writing about different approaches and ideas they’ve tried and "
"what they’ve got out of them. But what I’ve noticed is that in the Summary section some of the "
"authors were saying that one of the most useful ideas in their experiments was blogging. "
"It forced them getting deeper into the subject, filling the gaps in their knowledge and "
"organizing it in their heads so they can publish that knowledge in text form. Also it was "
"motivating not to give up the project. So I’ve decided to try blogging myself despite "
"my introversion \u{1f605}."

"My main work tools in the recent time are Kotlin " (icon(KOTLIN)) " and Python " (icon(PYTHON))
", and my favorite language, undoubtedly, is Rust " (icon(RUST)) ". Rust is a systems "
"programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. "
"I didn’t like using JVM-based languages because I’ve simply got tired of them, and there are not "
"that many variants of the technology: that’s either bare netty, or relatively "
"heavy servers like vertx or Tomcat/jetty+Spring MVC. And I wouldn’t sleep well if my blog that "
"by design should efficiently use computing resources was written in interpreted language "
"such as Python " (icon(PYTHON)) ". In this way, I was happy to exclude all options to make "
"Rust win \u{1f606}. According to the "
a href="https://www.arewewebyet.org/" target="_blank" { "arewewebyet.org" } " at the "
"moment there are a few web frameworks in Rust’s ecosystem. At first I was "
"looking at " a href="https://crates.io/crates/rocket" target="_blank" { "Rocket" } " just "
"because I like how routes are specified with directives above functions and negligible "
"amount of boilerplate to write. But while I was writing this post I’ve stumbled upon a "
a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17&hw=ph&test=plaintext" target="_blank" { "benchmark" }
" that showed Rocket sucks at performance. Instead there was a leader in rust called "

"put posts under version control and leave everything that is needed to run the blog here: "

"Of course, I had thoughts that if I have no registration, comments, but only "
"static blog posts, I don't need any dynamic server. Just take Nginx, a bunch of HTML and CSS "
"files and go. But no, it’s boring! Besides that, I’d have to implement one of the conceived "
"features with JavaScript: the day/night theme switcher. "
"There is too much entropy in this world to write even more JS. "
"I confess, I still had to write one line of JavaScript to make that feature work: switching "
"the day/night color theme. This line contains single expression that toggles the "
code { "night" } "CSS class on the " code { "html" } " element and sets the corresponding cookie "
"so the server would know if it needs to render pages with the night theme when you visit "
"another page. I like it more than the JS solution: page loads always light, and then when JS is "
"loaded, it checks the cookie and sets the corresponding class. "

"As I wrote above, I’ve chosen " a href="https://actix.rs" target="_blank" { "actix-web" }
" as a web server, the pages are stored as templates, and are rendered on the server side, "
"they contain single JS line of code, and a tiny bit of CSS so your eyes won’t bleed. All the "
"UI graphics is SVG and " code { "favicon.ico" } " is generated in several sizes out of SVG too. "
"I’ve chosen " a href="https://crates.io/crates/maud" target="_blank" { "Maud" } " as a "
"template engine - I like how it accepts macros as Rust templates and bakes them into "
"static strings at compile time. It all sounds good and well, like it will run fast and "
"take little space, but I was not satisfied yet and thought that if templates are baked "
"into binary file, it would be cool to also include all the static resources into it! "
"All of them: styles, graphics, fonts, whatever. And it turned out there is a library for "
"that: " a href="https://crates.io/crates/includedir" target="_blank" { "includedir" } ". "
"No sooner said then done. The " code { "includedir" } "crate takes contents of specified "
"directory and puts it into a binary as byte arrays which are mapped by their relative "
"paths with the " a href="https://crates.io/crates/phf" target="_blank" { "phf" } " crate. "

a href = "https://llvm.org/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.html" target ="_blank" { "link time optimization" }
